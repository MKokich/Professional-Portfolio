          My name is Mihaela Kokich and I live in Seattle, WA. I have a dog named Corona and a sweet one eyed cat, whom I like to call "cat". Currently, I work in healthcare benefits management and am enrolled in the DU Coding Bootcamp part time. I look forward to completing this education and moving on to a web development career, and hopefully the opportunity to live overseas.
          <br>
          I was born in Romania and adopted by a family from Seattle, WA so that's where I was raised. I played softball from a young age throughout high school as well as on a select team. Playing sports was a passion of mine and I believe it taught me a lot about being a team player and striving to always do my best. 
          <br>
          I love to travel and have lived in many different states. I am hoping this new career will allow me to explore more of this beautiful planet and the different cultures within it. My favorite places I've visited so far are South Africa, Budapest and Thailand. I have a passion for photography, so when I travel I tend to take many photos and one day I hope to sell them and share my adventures with others. </p>
